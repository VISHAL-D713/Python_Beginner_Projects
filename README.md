# Python Projects Collection

---

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of **Python projects** I created as part of my learning journey over the past few months.  
All programs are built from a **beginner’s perspective**, focusing on understanding Python fundamentals, logic implementation, and integrating libraries for real-world features.

Projects included cover a variety of applications, from banking systems to practical helpers for students and simple business simulations.

## Projects Included

1. **Banking System with Speech-to-Text**  
   - A simple banking program allowing deposits, withdrawals, and account management.  
   - Integrated **speech-to-text** functionality to perform actions using voice commands.  
   - Helps understand Python classes, functions, and libraries for audio input.

2. **Cafe Billing System**  
   - Generates bills for cafe orders.  
   - Demonstrates handling inputs, calculations, and printing formatted outputs.

3. **Python Calendar Program**  
   - Allows you to create and view calendars in Python.  
   - Aims to understand the `calendar` module and date handling.

4. **Practical Batch Finder**  
   - Input your **batch and day** to know which practical you need to perform.  
   - Useful for automating simple scheduling tasks and understanding conditional logic.

5. **Shopping Cart Program**  
   - Simulates a basic shopping cart experience.  
   - Includes adding items, calculating totals, and simple inventory tracking.

6. **Mini Subject Management System (Faculty Perspective)**  
   - A lightweight system to manage subjects and practical schedules.  
   - Introduces basic CRUD operations in Python and file handling.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** – Core programming language  
- **Standard Libraries** – `calendar`, `os`, `datetime`  
- **Speech Recognition Library** – `speech_recognition` for voice commands in the banking system

## Learnings from these Projects

- Hands-on practice with **Python basics, loops, and conditionals**.  
- Understanding **object-oriented programming** in small-scale projects.  
- Integrating external libraries such as **speech-to-text**.  
- Creating simple **real-world applications** like billing and scheduling.  
- Managing multiple scripts and understanding **project structure**.  

---

## Future Improvements

- Add **GUI** for all programs using `Tkinter` or `PyQt` for better user experience.  
- Enhance error handling and input validation.  
- Convert some scripts into **modules/packages** for easier reuse.  
- Explore **database integration** for projects like the banking system and subject management.
